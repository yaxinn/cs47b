To run the Checker program described in the "Blocks Project" writeup,
copy the files ~cs47b/lib/Checker.class and ~cs47b/lib/TrayVerifier.class
to the directory that contains your Solver program.  Run the Checker program
by sending it the output of your Solver program.  On a UNIX system, you can
do that with the following command:
    java Solver init goal | java Checker init goal
(Init and goal stand for names of files containing the initial and goal 
configurations, respectively.)
